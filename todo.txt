Main:
- Add functionality around HasMoved to be at piece level, so that checking for castling (king / rook hasn't moved) is possible
- Add check for HasMoved on king/rook and some function to make sure castling is possible, aka not moving through check, and isLineClear between start / destination for each piece
- Make a check for moving out of check being capturing the attacking piece, as well as just the king moving to safety (taking attacking piece should be a valid way to do so)
- Remake the translator in an internal translation package
- Refactor the generation package to use the new structure changes
- Refactor the random game play to use all the new stuff

Extra:
- Maybe add validation to make sure you can't use standard moving notation to capture a piece (needs to have 'x' in the notation to work)
- Externalise the config by adding it to a terraform file? (Learn terraform)
