Main:
- Add IsCheck functionality to the board
- Add IsCheckMate functionality to the board
- Remake the translator in an internal translation package
- Refactor the generation package to use the new structure changes
- Refactor the random game play to use all the new stuff

Extra:
- Maybe add validation to make sure you can't use standard moving notation to capture a piece (needs to have 'x' in the notation to work)
- Externalise the config by adding it to a terraform file? (Learn terraform)
